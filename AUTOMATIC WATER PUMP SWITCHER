20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 1 - AUTOMATIC WATER PUMP SWITCHER 

<ABSTRACT>

An automated water pump switcher is an advanced system designed to automate 
the operation of water pumps, ensuring efficient water management in various 
applications. This system utilizes sensors to continuously monitor the water
levels in tanks, reservoirs, or wells. When the water level drops below a 
specified threshold, the switcher activates the pump to fill the tank. Conversely,
when the tank reaches its maximum level, the system automatically turns off the
pump to prevent overflow. This automation eliminates the need for manual control, 
reducing human effort and minimizing the risk of pump damage due to dry running or 
overloading. Additionally, it conserves energy by ensuring the pump operates only
when necessary, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. 

<INTRODUCTION>

Water is a vital resource, and efficient water management is essential in residential,
agricultural, and industrial sectors. Traditional methods of controlling water pumps 
often require manual operation, which can lead to inefficiencies such as water wastage,
energy loss, and equipment damage due to human error. To address these challenges, an 
automatic water pump switcher has been developed as a smart solution that automates the 
process of water pumping based on real-time water level monitoring. This system ensures 
that the pump operates only when necessary, turning on when water levels are low and 
switching off when the desired level is reached. By integrating sensor technology, 
the automatic water pump switcher offers a reliable, energy-efficient, and cost-effective 
approach to water management, reducing manual labor while promoting sustainable use of 
resources.

<OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE>

*OBJECTIVE
