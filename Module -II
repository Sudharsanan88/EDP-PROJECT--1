20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 2 - AUTOMATIC ROOF SHED USING RELAY 

<ABSTRACT>

An automated roof shed system using relays is designed to provide smart,
efficient control over the opening and closing of roof structures, 
typically for agricultural, industrial, or residential applications.
The system uses sensors to detect environmental conditions such as rain, 
sunlight, or temperature and activates the roof shed accordingly through 
relay switches. When specific conditions are met, such as rain detection, 
the relay triggers the motor to close the roof, protecting the area underneath. 
Conversely, the system opens the roof when favorable conditions return.
This automation eliminates the need for manual intervention, ensures timely 
operation, and enhances the protection of crops, equipment, or living spaces. 
The use of relays offers reliable switching, low power consumption, and precise 
control, making the system cost-effective and energy-efficient. Overall, 
it promotes convenience, resource conservation, and improved environmental adaptability.

<INTRODUCTION>

An automatic roof shed system using a relay is a simple yet effective solution designed
to provide automated control over a roof covering mechanism. By utilizing sensors, such
as rain or temperature sensors, in conjunction with a relay switch, the system can detect 
environmental conditions and trigger the opening or closing of the roof shed accordingly. 
This setup ensures optimal protection against weather changes, enhances convenience, and 
reduces the need for manual intervention, making it ideal for use in homes, agricultural 
setups, or industrial environments.
